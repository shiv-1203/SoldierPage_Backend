I recently had the privilege of spearheading the development of a Soldier page for Battlefield 4, leveraging the design and assets meticulously outlined in the [Figma UI's "#menu soldier" frame](https://www.figma.com/community/file/992422778538944984). 


This multifaceted project encompassed the orchestration of backend and frontend components, employing Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. The culmination of these efforts is a sophisticated web application, accessible at [Soldier Page](https://battlefield-4-webflow-rebuild.webflow.io/game?tab=tab-soldier), providing users with an immersive platform to explore in-depth Battlefield 4 soldier profiles. 


In tandem with this, I meticulously crafted a clone of the Soldier page, seamlessly integrating the aforementioned design and features. The clone, accessible here, promises users a distinctive yet familiar interaction. The project exemplifies the seamless amalgamation of design principles and cutting-edge technologies, showcasing the successful creation of a responsive and captivating web platform tailored for Battlefield 4 enthusiasts.
